NodeJS Backend Engineer (Intern) assessment test

The task:
Create a simple rule-validation API.
(You are welcome to use ANY framework or third party library of your choice)

The response structure for your API should be fashioned after the popular JSEND pattern. 

Example:

    {
      "message": "API response message",
      "status": "success",
      "data": {
        isValidForRule: true,
      }
    }

**"message"** - Apt response message for your API. (Unless otherwise stated, this message can be anything you decide)

**"status"** - Status for your API response. The two possible values for this prop are "success" and "error" (PS: This isn't the response HTTP status code)

**"data"** - This is the meat of your API response. It should contain your actual response data.


Your rule-validation API should have just two routes:

1/ First route is the base route. HTTP GET "/"

It should return with data in the following format:
   

     {
          "message": "My Rule-Validation API"
          "status": "success",
          "data": {
            "name": "Amos Burton",
            "github": "@amosburton",
            "email": "amosburton@rocinantecrew.com",
            "mobile": "08069920011",
            "twitter": "@amosb"
          }
        }

Please note:
a/ name should be your full name
b/ github should be your github handle (the '@' symbol must be included)
c/ email should be your preferred email of contact 
d/ mobile should be your preferred mobile number of contact 
e/ twitter should be your twitter handle (the '@' symbol must be included). [PS: This field is optional, you can choose to include it in your response or not]

2/ Second route is the rule validation route. HTTP POST "/validate-rule"
The route should accept JSON data containing a rule and data field to validate the rule against. Example:

    {
      "rule": {
        "field": "missions"
        "condition": "gte",
        "condition_value": 30
      },
      "data": {
        "name": "James Holden",
        "crew": "Rocinante",
        "age": 34,
        "position": "Captain",
        "missions": 45
      }
    }

Endpoint requirements/constraints:
a/ The rule and data fields are required.

b/ The rule field should be a valid JSON object and should contain the following required fields: 
b1/ field: The field in the data passed to validate the rule against
b2/ condition: The condition to use for validating the rule. Accepted condition values are:
    i/ eq: Means the field value should be equal to the condition value 
    ii/ neq: Means the field value should not be equal to the condition value 
    iii/ gt: Means the field value should be greater than the condition value 
    iv/ gte: Means the field value should be greater than or equal to the condition value 
    v/ contains: Means the field value should contain the condition value
b3/ condition_value: The condition value to run the rule against. Your rule evaluation is expected to be like ["data.field"] ["rule.condition"] ["rule.condition_value"]

c/ The data field can be any of:
c1/ A valid JSON object 
c2/ A valid array
c3/ A string

d/ If a required field isn't passed. Your endpoint should return with a response (HTTP 400 status code) that is similar to the below:

    {
      "message": "[field] is required."
      "status": "error",
      "data": null
    }

E.g. if the rule field is not passed, your endpoint response should be:

    {
      "message": "rule is required."
      "status": "error",
      "data": null
    }

e/ If a field is of the wrong type, your endpoint should return with a response (HTTP 400 status code) that is similar to the below:

    {
      "message": "[field] should be a|an [type]."
      "status": "error",
      "data": null
    }

E.g. if the rule field is passed as a number instead of a valid object, your endpoint response should be:

    {
      "message": "rule should be an object."
      "status": "error",
      "data": null
    }

f/ If an invalid JSON payload is passed to your API, your endpoint response (HTTP 400 status code) should be:

    {
      "message": "Invalid JSON payload passed."
      "status": "error",
      "data": null
    }

[PS: For the error responses described above, please note that the punctuation is important. I.e the period at the end of each error message.]

g/ If the field specified in the rule object is missing from the data passed, your endpoint response (HTTP 400 status code) should be:

    {
      "message": "field [name of field] is missing from data."
      "status": "error",
      "data": null
    }

e.g. 

    {
      "message": "field age is missing from data."
      "status": "error",
      "data": null
    }

h/ If the rule is successfully validated, your endpoint response (HTTP 200 status code) should be:

    {
      "message": "field [name of field] successfully validated."
      "status": "success",
      "data": {
        "validation": {
          "error": false,
          "field": "[name of field]",
          "field_value": [value of field],
          "condition": "[rule condition]",
          "condition_value: [condition value]
        }
      }
    }

e.g.

    {
      "message": "field missions successfully validated."
      "status": "success",
      "data": {
        "validation": {
          "error": false,
          "field": "missions",
          "field_value": 30,
          "condition": "gte",
          "condition_value: 30
        }
      }
    }

i/ If the rule validation fails, your endpoint response (HTTP 400 status code) should be:

    {
      "message": "field [name of field] failed validation."
      "status": "error",
      "data": {
        "validation": {
          "error": false,
          "field": "[name of field]",
          "field_value": [value of field],
          "condition": "[rule condition]",
          "condition_value: [condition value]
        }
      }
    }


    {
      "message": "field missions failed validation."
      "status": "error",
      "data": {
        "validation": {
          "error": true,
          "field": "missions",
          "field_value": 30,
          "condition": "gte",
          "condition_value: 54
        }
      }
    }
